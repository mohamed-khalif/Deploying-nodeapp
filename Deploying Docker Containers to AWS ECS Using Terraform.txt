Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, itâ€™s essential to have the following tools installed on your computer:

Docker Engine
HashiCorp Terraform
AWS CLI
Node.js runtime
Github


SECTION: setting up the docker app
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-khalif/deploying-nodeapp
cd demo_node_app
npm init --y
npm install express
node index.js
Open http://localhost:5000/ on your browser and check if the application is working. You should see the following basic CRUD web app:


SECTION: Dockerize the app
Once the Dockerfile has been created then run the following cmd:
docker build -t sample-app .
docker run -it -p 5000:5000 sample-app
http://localhost:5000/ should serve the same application, but this time from a Docker container.



SECTION: Building underlying infrastructure

1. Provider Configuration
Specify the required AWS provider version, access keys, and region.

2. ECR Repository Creation
Create an ECR repository named "app-repo" to store Docker container images.

3. ECS Cluster Creation
Establish an ECS cluster named "app-cluster."

4. ECS Task Definition
Define an ECS task named "app-first-task":
Specify container details (image, ports, memory, CPU).
Ensure compatibility with Fargate launch type.
Set up networking specifics and execution role.

5. IAM Role Creation for ECS Task Execution
Create an IAM role "ecsTaskExecutionRole" allowing ECS tasks to assume the role.
Establish a policy for the role to execute ECS tasks.

6. VPC and Subnet Creation
Create a default VPC and subnets in two availability zones within "us-east-1."

7. Application Load Balancer (ALB) Configuration
Set up an ALB named "load-balancer-dev" across created subnets.
Define a security group allowing inbound traffic on port 80.

8. Security Group for Load Balancer
Create a security group for the load balancer allowing inbound traffic on port 80 from all sources.

9. Load Balancer Target Group Configuration
Establish a target group for the load balancer to route traffic to IP-based targets.

10. Load Balancer Listener Configuration
Configure a listener for the load balancer on port 80, forwarding traffic to the target group.

11. ECS Service Configuration
Set up an ECS service named "app-first-service" associated with the ECS cluster:
Specify task definition, launch type, desired container count, and load balancer details.
Configure network settings, assigning public IPs, and defining security groups.

12. Security Group for ECS Service
Define a security group for the ECS service, allowing inbound traffic only from the load balancer security group.

13. Output
Log the application's load balancer URL as an output.
